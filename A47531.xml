            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the former Latin Edition thrice Printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> which is now put
into his hands; but this Engliſh Copy (as that word is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood
by the Bookſellers,) may rather be eſteemed as an <hi>Original Piece,</hi>
or a new, more compleat, and perfect draught, begun, and finiſhed afterwards
by the ſame hand; by which it is beſides very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged with divers
interpolations, and an addition of new Remarques upon ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Texts.

time ſhe brought forth her firſt born ſon he knew her not, to wit, the

Nequaquam minima, <hi>In no wiſe the leaſt;</hi> or, as we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate it,
<hi>art not the leaſt.</hi> This place as to the words doth diametrically
fight with that in <hi>Micah</hi> c. 5. v. 2. out of which nevertheleſs it
was probably cited, it being not to be found in any other <hi>Prophet. And thou
Bethlehem art not the leaſt,</hi> as it is here in <hi>Matth. And thou
Bethlehem Ephratah art little,</hi> as it is in <hi>Micah.</hi> Though as to
the ſence all Expoſitors agree they both mean the ſame thing. But they
ſay this place in <hi>Matt.</hi> is the more ſignificant and plain,
ſuppoſing that he reſtored it to its original and proper meaning. When as
in truth the words are not the words of <hi>Matthew,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely by him
hiſtorically recited, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the words of the high Prieſt and
Scribes, who anſwered <hi>Herod</hi> upon his demand, where <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſhould be born, <hi>In Bethlehem of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, for ſo it is written by the
Prophet. And thou Bethlehem in the Land of Juda art not the least among the

think there is no cauſe to doubt. But this difference in the reading giving a

hope it will be an offence to none, at leaſt to move the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:97245:10"/>
queſtion, whether it may not be poſſible that ſome fault might creep
into this place of <hi>Micah</hi> by the neglect or inadvertency of one of the

they were better inſtructed then other Nations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the expectation of
a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or that <hi>God</hi> had more kindneſs for them,

<hi>Non ſervaretur ulla caro.</hi> The moſt received expoſition of this

unleſs the ſiege of the City had been extreamly haſtned, there had not

poſſible, and ſo to ſhorten the days of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi>

<hi>Jeruſalems</hi> deſtruction, <hi>no fleſh,</hi> that is <hi>not one
Jew had been ſaved,</hi> but they had all eternally periſhed. For as long
as their Temple ſtood, and the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices and Ceremonies
remained, it was ſuch a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block to the whole Nation, that
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all did ſtumble at it, neither were they few who for that very

mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Eagle.</hi> And here I cannot but take notice of the
happineſs of his expoſition, who gives this meaning of the place. The
Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe is the <hi>Jews</hi> who lay dead in their ſins, and by the
<hi>Eagles</hi> are meant the <hi>Roman Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> who for every Legion bore
two <hi>Eagles</hi> for their Enſign, ſo that the word <hi>Eagles</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came often uſed by <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> for the
<hi>Roman Armies,</hi> Nath. Ward. And in my opinion this ſeems to agree much
more with the ſcope of the place, then that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who liken our
<hi>Saviour</hi> to a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, on which <hi>Chriſtians</hi> like
ravenons <hi>Eagles</hi> ſhould make their prey. For to ſpeak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Quid hoc ad Rhombum? <hi>What is this to the purpoſe?</hi> But as it is
eaſie to add to what already is invented, we may perhaps with better reaſon
ſuppoſe that by this <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe</hi> 
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:97245:28"/> may be meant
the <hi>Jewiſh State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which now by reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſtructions among themſelves, and their oppreſſion under the
<hi>Roman</hi> power, lay plainly dead as is a <hi>Carcaſe.</hi> And ſo as
<hi>Eagles</hi> and Birds of prey do uſually out of a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſagacity follow Armies in expectation of the prey of the dead bodies after
the fight, ſo ſhould the <hi>Roman Armies</hi> prefigured in thoſe
<hi>Eagles,</hi> whoſe pourtractures they carried in their Banners, be
gathered together in that place, where the <hi>Jewiſh State</hi> lay now as
dead and helpleſs as is a <hi>Carcaſe,</hi> in hope and expectation of the

Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely whatever is within, the inſide of the cup is throughly to be

finally to conclude, that this firſt branch of the verſe concerns only his
Soul, as the latter plainly concerns his body, which ſaw no corruption as
other human bodies do. And in this ſenſe doth <hi>Peter</hi> expreſsly
explain the words, v. 31. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:97245:54"/> ſaith <hi>Hilary, It
is a law of humane neceſſity, that the bodies being buried, the Souls
deſcend into Hell, which deſcent the Lord himſelf did not refuſe, to
ſhew the truth of his manhood, or human nature.</hi> And doubtleſs this is
the ſcope of <hi>Peters</hi> words in this place, of purpoſe to prove the
Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that he was not left in the ſtate of
death as other mortals are. And this opinion I hold to be pious and conſonant
to faith. I believe the immortality of the Soul, I believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the body, and its reunition with the Soul, and life everlaſting, I am no
friend to Purgatory, nor to any prayer, ſupplication or application to any
<hi>Saint,</hi> ſave only to our ſole <hi>Mediator Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
who for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular end aſcended into <hi>the holy of holies,</hi> that
is, into the <hi>higheſt heavens,</hi> that there he may commend our prayers
to our <hi>Father</hi> which is in heaven; who from hence alſo conceive may
be drawn a cogent argument, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ought not to be made to
<hi>Saints,</hi> whom Religion hath not yet placed in that <hi>holy of
holies,</hi> to wit, <hi>the higheſt heavens,</hi> and ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for
fitting <hi>Mediators.</hi> But there are not few and thoſe no mean ones
neither, who poſitively ſay, there is no receptacle of Souls, but affirm
that the Souls of the Godly do immediately after their ſeparation from their
bodies go into heaven, that is to ſay, as I ſuppoſe, that heaven which is
properly called <pb n="94" facs="tcp:97245:55"/> heaven. One of whoſe great Arguments is
from that of <hi>Luke</hi> c. 23. v. 43. Hodie eris mecum in Paradiſo,
<hi>Thou ſhalt be with me this day in Paradiſe.</hi> But that day our
<hi>Saviour</hi> was not in heaven, unleſs they ſpeak and mean
<hi>ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocally,</hi> for he was not yet aſcended either in human Soul or
Body, as far as Scripture doth, or reaſon can inform us. <hi>Paradiſe</hi>
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be ſome other place, namely, this <hi>Hades</hi> or
<hi>Hell,</hi> as we Tranſlate it, in which for a ſhort time his Soul was
held, to which he properly went, or may be ſaid to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and in
which the ſame day together with his Soul was alſo the Soul of the Thief,
where together with the reſt of the Souls of the Godly that are departed (our

aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> they alſo aſcended with him into
heaven, and were there conſummate and made perfect, as to their Souls which
then were received into heaven, which before the Aſcenſion of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> were not aſcended. In anſwer whereunto, I do truly
acknowledge, but not in their ſenſe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> by his
<hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance</hi> or <hi>Aſcenſion into heaven did open the Kingdom heaven
to all believers,</hi> which before was ſhut to all the world ſave only to
the <hi>Jews,</hi> but ſince the time of his Paſſion and Aſcenſion
open to any one that ſtrives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo as its now lawful for all
perſons of all Nations to preſs into it, who ſhall believe in his Name.
But to meet the argument, I beſeech you, where were the Souls of the
<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> before they Aſcended with <hi>Chriſt</hi> into heaven?
For where ever they were, reaſon perſwades it, and Scripture doth not deny
it, in the ſame place was the Soul of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and where was the
Soul of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there was alſo the Soul of the <hi>Thief,</hi> They
were not yet Aſcended, Neither ſurely were they in a place of torment, for
I cannot think it could be any comfort to the Thief, as I ſuppoſe, it was
intended, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have told him that he ſhould be that
day with him in a place of torment, it muſt therefore be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
concluded, that they were in ſome third place of reſt. In which place if we
affirm <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97245:56"/> that the Souls of all the Godly departed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
till the laſt day, what danger is there, what incommodity? If we believe, I
ſay, and believe no more, that there remains to all a Reſurrection in the
laſt day, both <hi>Fathers</hi> and us, in which day we with them ſhall be
moſt perfectly conſummate, and that in the mean while all <hi>the Souls of
the Godly are in the hands of God,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>. <hi>In a place due and proper to
them,</hi> as it is in the Epiſtle of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to the
<hi>Philippians.</hi> And all this while not a moment of time if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with
Eternity. Neither <hi>were the old Chriſtians wont,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi>
ſaith, <hi>to call this middle ſtate of place and time between this life
and the Reſurrection, by the name of heaven.</hi> But I contain my ſelf,
this queſtion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a longer and larger diſquiſition, then to be
ſhut up in ſo narrow limits. And yet a queſtion, which neither Scripture
nor any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Synod</hi> had ever yet explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determined for an Article of Faith, before the <hi>Convocation</hi> at
<hi>Dublin</hi> 1615. Which did then indeed ſo define it. <hi>That after the
end of this life the Souls of the Sons of God were immediately received into
heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Perhaps of purpoſe to meet with the <hi>Romiſh
Purgatory.</hi> Neither ſhould I have ſaid thus much, but that many
perſons do ſo tenaciouſly maintain this laſt opinion for an Article of
their Faith, that they condemn all who hold otherwiſe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety 
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:97245:56"/> and hereſie. And that theſe words ſeemed to me ſo
plain, that as it were they led me by the hand to the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which I have here laid down, though rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that reſpect obſerved of

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Et inde poſtquam mortuus eſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ejus, tranſtulit
illum in hanc terram in qua vos nunc habitatis, <hi>And from thence after his
Father was dead, he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell.</hi> It
hath not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled <hi>Interpreters,</hi> that <hi>Stephen</hi>
ſhould here ſay, that <hi>God</hi> removed <hi>Abraham</hi> out of
<hi>Charran</hi> after the death of his Father, becauſe it is ſaid,
<hi>Gen.</hi> c. 12. v. 4. That <hi>Abraham</hi> went out of <hi>Charran</hi>
in the 75 year of his age, and c. 11. v. 26. that he was born in the 70 year of
<hi>Terah</hi> his age, and v. 32. that <hi>Terah</hi> was 205 years old when
he died. For from hence it follows that <hi>Terah</hi> overlived the departure
of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Charran</hi> 60 years. Therefore to untie this
knot almoſt all our late <hi>Chronologers</hi> and <hi>Interpreters,</hi> all
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions exploded, will have <hi>Abraham</hi> to be born in the 130 year
of <hi>Terahs</hi> age, and not in the 70, as others of Ancient times have
thought, for if to 130 years you add 75 which was the age of <hi>Abraham</hi>
when he went out of <hi>Charran,</hi> you fall juſt into the true year of the
death of <hi>Terah.</hi> And to make this opinion good, they ſay, it is not
neceſſary that from <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 11. v. 26. it ſhould be
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that <hi>Abraham</hi> was born in the 70 <pb n="102" facs="tcp:97245:59"/>
year of <hi>Terah,</hi> but that in that year <hi>Terah</hi> began to be a
<hi>Father.</hi> For that it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi>
was born in that year, but that <hi>Terah lived</hi> 70 <hi>years and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
Abraham, Nahor, and Haran,</hi> from whence they will not have it concluded
that <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Eldeſt Brother, becauſe firſt named, but
ſay they, it is more likely he was the Youngeſt, and that for
preheminencies ſake only he was firſt named of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And that
they may make this opinion yet ſurer, they frame an argument out of their own
<hi>ſuppoſita,</hi> whereby they think to faſten an abſurdity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe of another judgment. Thus, If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> were the Eldeſt Son,
then <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife the Daughter to his Brother <hi>Haran,</hi> and
but Ten years Younger then <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> c. 17. v. 17. muſt
neceſſarily be born to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran in the Eighth year of his age,</hi> which
would be ridiculous to affirm But to anſwer this argument in the firſt
place. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſee no cauſe to grant that <hi>Sarah</hi> was
the Daughter of <hi>Haran.</hi> For that queſtion is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd. For
who that reads <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 20. v. 12. <hi>Indeed ſhe is my ſiſter,
ſhe is the daughter of my Father, but not the daughter of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
will not confidently conclude that <hi>Sarah</hi> was the Siſter of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Terah,</hi> but not by one and the
ſame wife? eſpecially ſuch a Solemn aſſeveration being added, as if
he had ſpoke it purpoſely <pb n="103" facs="tcp:97245:59"/> to free himſelf from the
ſuſpicion of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſly. Whereupon <hi>Hierome,</hi> after
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expoſition of the words firſt, addeth, Sed quia in Hebraeo habet,
Verè ſoror mea eſt, filia Patris mei, ſed non filia Matris meae,
magis ſonat quod Abrahae ſoror fuit. In excuſationem ejus dicimus, nec
dum illo tempore tales nuptias eſſe prohibitas. <hi>But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is in
the Hebrew, Indeed ſhe is my ſiſter, ſhe is the daughter of my Father,
but not the daughter of my Mother, it ſounds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhe was Abrahams
ſiſter. We ſay for his excuſe, that as yet ſuch marriages were not
prohibited.</hi> As alſo the <hi>Hebrew Doctors,</hi> among the ſix ſorts
of unjuſt copulations, reckon that for one, cum ſorore uterina, <hi>with
the ſiſter by the Mother.</hi> Nay <hi>Muſculus</hi> is yet more plain,
Omnia haec commenta ſimplicitas Hebraica reſpuit, quid eſt enim
neceſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queri in re tam clare expreſſa? <hi>&amp;c. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
ſimplicity rejects all theſe devices, for what neceſſity is there to be
troubled in a thing ſo clearly expreſſed? He ſaith, Indeed ſhe is my
ſiſter, the daughter of my Father, and that ſhe might not be thought to
be of one and the ſame belly, he adds, and not the daughter of my Mother,
ſo that it is manifeſt, that Sarah was born to Terah by another wife, then
that of whom he had Abraham.</hi> To this may be added out of
<hi>Euſebius,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97245:60"/> Abrahamus verò à Patre accipit uxorem
ſuam Saram, <hi>Abraham taketh his wife Sarah from his Father,</hi> not from
<hi>Haran.</hi> And by this appears that this queſtion is not yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
But be it granted that <hi>Sarah</hi> was <hi>Iſchah</hi> and <hi>the
daughter of Haran,</hi> what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but <hi>Abraham</hi> might be born when
<hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> was Forty years of age? And then how eaſily might
<hi>Sarah</hi> be the Daughter of <hi>Haran,</hi> and but Ten years Younger
then <hi>Abraham,</hi> and no abſurdity follow that <hi>Haran</hi> was but
Eight years old when <hi>Sarah</hi> was born? For though the Scripture ſay,
That <hi>Terah</hi> lived 70 years and begat <hi>Abraham, Nahor and
Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> it doth not therefore neceſſarily follow, that <hi>Terah</hi>
at that time began to be a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> no more then that <hi>Terah</hi>
begat them all in that year, which I ſuppoſe no man will affirm; or that
<hi>Noah</hi> began to be a <hi>Father,</hi> when he is ſaid to have been
<hi>Five hundred years old,</hi> and <hi>to have begotten, Shem, Ham and
Japhet.</hi> But certainly it is much more probable, that <hi>Terah</hi> began
to be a <hi>Father</hi> about the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, and about that time
begat <hi>Haran,</hi> about which time his <hi>Progenitors</hi> began to be
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and about which time our late <hi>Chronologers</hi> would
have <hi>Cainan</hi> (whom <hi>Luke</hi> interpoſeth in his Genealogy) begin
to be a <hi>Father.</hi> I ſay <hi>Haran,</hi> becauſe he ſeemeth to be
the Eldeſt Brother, if both <hi>Nahor</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> married his
Daughters. But if <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> 
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:97245:60"/> were born to
<hi>Terah</hi> in his Thirtieth year, it behooved him to be 40 years old when
<hi>Abraham</hi> was born to <hi>Terah</hi> in his 70<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and if
<hi>Sarah</hi> were born to <hi>Haran</hi> in the 50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age, which
it is lawful and fit enough to gueſs, then muſt ſhe be Ninety years old
when <hi>Abraham</hi> was an Hundred. So that the argument which would fix an
abſurdity upon Diſſenters, falls to the ground either way. And of this
opinion, which to me ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable and equal, <hi>Joſephus</hi> gave
me the hint, <hi>Antiq. Jud. lib.</hi> 1. where he expreſsly affirms that
<hi>Abraham</hi> was born in the 70<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of <hi>Terah,</hi> and afterwards
apart, that <hi>he had to his brothers Nahor and Haran,</hi> without having any
regard to their age, as being not material, and as if they might have been born
at any other time, even before the 70<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of their <hi>Father.</hi> For there
is mention made of them only becauſe they are named in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Hiſtory. And the ſame with Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I ſuppoſe may in the like
manner be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the <hi>Patriarch Noah,</hi> that is to ſay, that
he begot <hi>Shem</hi> in the 500 year of his age, neither in that year began
to be a <hi>Father,</hi> but that <hi>Shem</hi> had Brothers, <hi>Japhet</hi>
and <hi>Cham,</hi> who might likewiſe have been born many years before the
500 year of <hi>Noah,</hi> named only <hi>Gen,</hi> c. 5. v. 32. becauſe
there is mention made of them in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Story, as in the ſame manner

               <hi>Nahor</hi> and <hi>Haran, Gen.</hi> c. 11.
v. 26. My arguments for either opinion are theſe. Firſt, It argues, that
<hi>Shem</hi> was born in the 500 year of <hi>Noah,</hi> becauſe it behooveth
his age, as alſo that of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be fix't, <hi>in whoſe

de Civit. Dei.</hi> But it is objected, that <hi>Shem</hi> could not be born in
the 500 year of <hi>Noah,</hi> becauſe its ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 11. v.
10. That <hi>Shem was an Hundred years old, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Arphaxad Two years after
the Floud,</hi> from whence they gather that <hi>Noah</hi> begat <hi>Shem</hi>
in the Five Hundred and Second year of his age. Whereof <hi>Scaliger</hi> gave
warning, <hi>Can. Iſag. lib.</hi> 3. Sciant verò Studioſi quoſdam

let Schollars know, that ſome do reckon two years more then we do from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
to the going out of Aegypt, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Birth time of Arphaxad,
which happened the ſecond year of the Floud. We have not omitted that year,
but we take the Five Hundreth year of Noah, and the Thouſand, Six 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97245:61"/> Hundred Fifty and Sixth year of the Floud from the
Creation of the World both current.</hi> For demonſtration ſake
ſuppoſe, that <hi>Noah</hi> was born the firſt day of the firſt month
(as all agree that he was born in the beginning of the year) and that in the
Five Hundreth year of his age he begat <hi>Shem,</hi> perhaps Fourteen days
before the year was fully ended, and then muſt <hi>Shem</hi> be an Hundred
years old fourteen days before the Six Hundreth year of <hi>Noah's</hi> age was
expired. So that when the Floud was dried up and <hi>Noah</hi> went out of the
<hi>Ark</hi> in the Six Hundred and firſt year of his age, <hi>in the
ſecond month and the Seven and Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of the month,</hi> Gen. c. 8.
v. 13, 14. then was <hi>Shem</hi> an Hundred years old, 14 days, one month and
27 days, that is, one Hundred years and 71 days old, on which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and
Twentieth day if <hi>Shem</hi> did firſt begin (as it is reaſonable and
lawful enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) to give his mind to the duty of Marriage after
the Floud, then from that day within the ſpace of 280 days, according to the
time of life, might <hi>Arphaxad</hi> be born, unto which if you add 71, the
remainder of the age of <hi>Shem</hi> after the Hundreth already reckoned,
there will be in the whole 351, ſo that there will be ſtill remaining of
the Hundreth year of the age of <hi>Shem</hi> yet <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> taking out
351 out of 365 days the whole ſpace of a year, 14 days. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97245:62"/> did not <hi>Scaliger</hi> unfitly take the 500 year of

the Floud, and conſequently the 1657 year from the Creation of the World, in

it can ſcarcely be believed, that <hi>Terah</hi> ſhould live 57 years

nor comprized in it, who cannot be denied to have been <hi>Judges,</hi> though
how long, it is not evident in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Euſebius</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Tradition gave them</hi> 18 <hi>years, Africanus</hi> allowed them 30, but
how long or ſhort ſo ever, it adds to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of 450 years, ſo that

days of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> into whoſe hands <hi>God</hi> gave the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> the ſpace of 40 years, are to be deducted out of
thoſe days, which muſt neceſſarily make the account not to be ſo
exact. <hi>Beroaldus</hi> hath made himſelf an unanſwerable objection. And
that is this. Putting or ſuppoſing that the time from the coming out of
<hi>Aegypt</hi> to the building of the Temple may not be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned to be
other then 480 years, as it is punctually ſet down, 1 <hi>King.</hi> c. 6. v.
1. which account himſelf and <hi>Beza</hi> do both maintain is preciſely to
be obſerved, if we allow 450 years to the Judges, adding 40 to
<hi>Moſes</hi> in the wilderneſs, 18 to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> (and none allow
him fewer) 40 to <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> 30 to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and

<hi>Temple,</hi> the whole will be (not reckoning the <hi>Elders</hi>) 582
years, <pb n="130" facs="tcp:97245:73"/> ſo as obſerving his own rule, it is
impoſſible that 450 years can be allowed to the times of the
<hi>Judges.</hi> Tis true he tells you, <hi>That it is to be noted for the
better underſtanding of the Apoſtle, That ſome years are repeated twice,
as the years of the Iſraelites oppreſſion are ſaid to be comprehended
in and referred to that ſumm of years, in which its ſaid there was peace,
and that the land had reſt from war. Whereof the Apoſtle being not at all
ſolicitous, did nominate that ſumm, which all the ſeveral ſumms</hi>
[of Judges and Oppreſſors] <hi>made up together.</hi> But that the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> had theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, the times of the
<hi>Elders</hi> and the 20 years of <hi>Sampſon</hi> making alſo the
account ſo imperfect and uncertain, or that he had none at all, is not
probable. Neither is it credible, that againſt the light of his own and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledge he would have mentioned a ſumm of years which was not

<hi>Iſaac</hi> they ſay, to the Birth of <hi>Jacob</hi> are 60 years, from
thence to their going into <hi>Aegypt</hi> 130, from thence to their coming out

the multitude met together, and <pb n="142" facs="tcp:97245:79"/> ſome choſe one man,

the Electors did uſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, to

they were numbred who choſe the one and who the other. And him who was
Elected by the moſt ſuffrages or voices, they placed in the high

after the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> times. And to prove this yet more fully, laying
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and barring all ſuſpected and queſtionable Authorities, let us
do it with ſuch Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Primitive writers, whoſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is
ſound and received of all. Beginning firſt with <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> c. 8. v. 19. Where the brother whoſe praiſe is in the

underſtood, by <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Impoſition of hands, and
Conſecration.</hi> And from him let us deſcend to the next Writers who are
univerſally counted genuine. In which rank in the firſt place is
<hi>Ignatius</hi> in his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi>
where you have theſe words, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<hi>Ye ought as a Church of God to chooſe or appoint a Biſhop,</hi> to wit,
for or to the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria.</hi> Where I ſuppoſe
likewiſe no body can ſoberly ſay that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are there

when he writes <hi>indefinitely</hi> to all the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> whom
he calls <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively</hi> the Church, and to whom he gives particular
inſtructions, not proper to the <hi>Biſhops</hi> if alone. And from him let
us come to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtorians, Among whom for the

ſuſpected Authority ſhould impoſe a law for the uſe of a word, on the
Teſtimony of others whoſe truth or credit was never yet call'd in
que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. I ſhall only add an argument or two. It is not likely that
<hi>Luke</hi> whom all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge skilful in the language of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> would uſe a word in a ſenſe not known unto them, nor
poſſible to be known Neither is it probable that none of the Ancient

ſenſe as is that of <hi>Zonaras</hi> his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, <hi>with Invocation

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore convinced with
theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and arguments I cannot but believe, that in Antient
times <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> did ſignifie no more then

<hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of hands</hi> or <hi>Conſecration,</hi> or, which we call

<hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by one man ſin entred into the world, and by ſin death,
even ſo death paſſeth upon all men, for that all have ſinned. For until
the Law,</hi> that is, before the Law <hi>ſin was in the world.</hi> That
ſin was in the world before the Law, ſeems to be the main thing that the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> here laboureth to prove, that he might meet with the tacite
or implied ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of thoſe who probably did deny that all men were
ſinners and the enemies of <hi>God,</hi> as he had before affirmed, v. 8. and
therefore did <hi>Sophiſtically</hi> argue, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died not
for all, becauſe ſin is the tranſgreſſion of the Law, but they which
had no Law, could not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs that which they had not, for <hi>the Law
was from Moſes,</hi> Joh. c. 1. v. 17. To meet therefore with their
objection, he uſeth this argument, <hi>As by one man ſin entred into the
world and by ſin death,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
For this very reaſon, <hi>Even ſo is death paſſed upon all men, for
that all have ſinned,</hi> none excepted. So that it appears moſt certainly
true that from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
for he ſpeaks of no other Law through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <pb n="161" facs="tcp:97245:88"/> the whole
Epiſtle, ſin was in the world. But it is farther objected, that ſin is
not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted where there is no Law, for <hi>the Law worketh wrath,</hi> c. 4.
v. 5. To which he gives no other anſwer, but an implicit one, the ſame in

<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit mors ab Adam, <hi>&amp;c. Yea death reigned from Adam to
Moſes,</hi> therefore was ſin not only in the world before the Law, but
alſo imputed before the Law. Their dying was an argument not only that they
had ſinned, but that alſo their ſin was imputed, for <hi>the wages of

its neceſſarily determined that all have ſinned, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
obnoxious to the puniſhment of death, even they who had <hi>not ſinned
after the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of Adams tranſgreſſion,</hi> for death reigned on
very Infants, who ſinned not actually, as <hi>Adam</hi> did,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:97245:89"/> my Faith to that interpretation, but rather argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to
diſſwade it. For truly if we ſpeak in a proper ſenſe, <hi>Adam</hi>

abſolutely neceſſary that the type of that which is good be good it
ſelf, and the type of that which is evil muſt be evil, otherwiſe it
cannot be a type. It is the ſence of <hi>Chryſoſtom in his Comment on the
Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi> c. 9. v. 23. Neither is there any will ſay
that <hi>Adam</hi> is a true and proper type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that he
is ſo only per antitheſim, <hi>or</hi> analogiam, <hi>by oppoſition of
contraries,</hi> or <hi>proportion,</hi> or by ſome <hi>intricate

conſtare ſimilitudinem, juxta ſpeciem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnantiam eſſe, <hi>That
there is a ſimilitude as to the Genus, a repugnancy as to the ſpecies.</hi>
Whereas <hi>Adam</hi> is properly, truly and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly, I may add aptly
and appoſitly to this place, ſaid to be the type of his off-ſpring which
was to come from his loins, and which he did ſo virtually repreſent in his
perſon, as that by his ſin they all became obnoxious to ſin and death.
And from theſe words thus expounded is formed as ſtrong an argument for
<hi>Original</hi> ſin as from any Text of Scripture. Neither do I ſeem to
be altogether without witneſs, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:97245:89"/> I have the
<hi>Aethiopick Verſion</hi> or <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> for me. The words
whereof in <hi>Latin</hi> are theſe. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtamen dominata eſt mors
propterea ab A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damo uſque ad Moſem, tam in iis qui peccave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, quem in
iis qui non peccaverunt, per illud peccatum Adami, eo quod unuſquiſque in
ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudine Adami creatus eſt, &amp; quia Adamus typus fuit illius qui
erat venturus, <hi>Nevertheleſs death reigned therefore from Adam to Moſes,
as well in thoſe that ſinned, as alſo in thoſe that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not, by
that ſin of Adam, becauſe that every one is born in the likeneſs of Adam,
and becauſe Adam was the type of him that was to come.</hi> From which words
I could make no other conſtruction, but that he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means that death did
reign over all by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> for theſe two cauſes,
becauſe every one was born, in the likeneſs of <hi>Adam,</hi> and becauſe
<hi>Adam</hi> was the type of him who was to come. Both which reaſons ſeem
to me one and the ſame, the one being a <hi>red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> or

all by the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was the type of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſurely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent argument. Whereas to affirm,
that death reigned over all by the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe
<hi>Adam</hi> was a type that repreſented all his Poſterity, methinks,

&amp;c. <hi>But to him that is of power to eſtabliſh you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my
Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. Why this <hi>Doxology</hi> is annexed now a days to the
end of this Chapter, I cannot but wonder at, when tis confeſt almoſt by
all, that theſe verſes, to wit, the 25, 26, 27, are found in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
copies, as they do alſo remain in the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> written in the
end of the 14 chapter, after thoſe words, <hi>Whatſoever is not of Faith,
is ſin,</hi> except the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> tranſcript, which (perhaps out
of abundant caution) reads it in both places. As far as I can conjecture of
this matter, it ſeems to me to be thus. There was a common opinion which
poſſibly from <hi>Hieroms</hi> words upon this place was derived to
poſterity, that <hi>Marcion</hi> the <hi>Haeretique</hi> did raſe or cut
out all the 15 <pb n="171" facs="tcp:97245:93"/> and 16 Chapters becauſe they thwarted
his opinion, and that he might the better cover his fraud, placed this
<hi>Doxology</hi> at the end of c. 14. becauſe he would have had the
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to end there. But I do very much doubt that this was ever done by
him, though I will not queſtion but he endeavoured to raſe out all the
reſt. I rather believe that the <hi>Orthodox Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe
times and their followers, induced with this opinion out of their zeal to meet
with <hi>Marcion,</hi> did purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove this <hi>Doxology</hi> from the
end of c. 14. where it was not fixed by the fraud of <hi>Marcion,</hi> but by
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf, to the end of c. 16. that ſo they might
include all which <hi>Marcion</hi> would have raſed out. I ſay they removed
it from its proper place for this cauſe, for I cannot conjecture for what
other reaſon they ſhould do it. Was it becauſe <hi>Doxologies</hi> were
more commodious in the end of an Epiſtle? ſurely no. For <hi>Eph.</hi> c.
3. v. 20, 21. there is the ſame <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> in the middle, and
<hi>Gal.</hi> c. 1. v. 5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> c. 1. v. 17. there is the like in
the beginning, and ſo in divers other places ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering through
<hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, but none in the end of any, where it was his
ſolemn cuſtom to uſe another <hi>Epilogue,</hi> which was <hi>his ſigne
in every Epiſtle, So I write, The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with
you all, Amen.</hi> Or was it becauſe this <hi>Doxology</hi> was more
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily <pb n="172" facs="tcp:97245:94"/> fit and proper for the end of the
Epiſtle? ſurely no. For it hath no cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all with the precedent
matter, but it ſuits and agreeth moſt exactly well with the end of c. 14.
where when the Apoſtle had through the whole chapter almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
of the danger of a doubting mind, moſt fitly follows this <hi>Doxology,</hi>

               </gap>, <hi>It was the cuſtom of Paul

ſenſe and Interpretation I ſhall borrow two arguments, the one from the
words immediately preceding, the other from thoſe which immediately follow.
The force of the argument from the words preceding is this, 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97245:104"/> 
               <hi>For the man is not of the woman but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of
the man, neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the
man.</hi> v. 8, 9. Ergo, <hi>Therefore ought the woman to acknowledge</hi> or
<hi>account the power to be in her</hi> husband, who is her <hi>head.</hi> You
have the ſame argument, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> c. 2. v. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Let the
woman be in ſilence in all ſubjection, for I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not a woman to
teach, nor to uſurp Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the man, but to be in ſilence.</hi> And
why ſo? <hi>For Adam was firſt made, then Eve.</hi> So as for this very
cauſe ſhe ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the power in her husband, to whom ſhe
ought to be in ſubjection, and over whom ſhe ought not to uſurp
Authority. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arguments are both the ſame, why ſhould we
queſtion, but the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intends the ſame direct ſenſe in
the one place, as in the other, when conſtruction and the uſe of words do
bear it? Why ſhould we fly to violent notions and remedies when there is no
need? The force of the other argument from the words that follow, v. 11, 12. is
this, becauſe they are a qualification or mitigation of the rigour of the
injunction, leaſt it might be taken by the husband in too ſtrict and
ſevere a ſenſe. As if he ſhould ſay, Although a woman ought to
acknowledge the power in her husband by the Law of their creation which was
delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 3. v. 16. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
neither is the man without the woman, <pb n="194" facs="tcp:97245:105"/> nor the woman
without the man by the Lord, for as the woman is of the man, even ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
is the man by the woman, but all things are of God.</hi> From whence is
neceſſarily inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that ſuch is the mutual bond of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between
the man and the woman, that becauſe one cannot be without the other, and
becauſe whatever they be, they are all of <hi>God,</hi> the man ought not to
indulge, challenge or aſſume by any means too much to his own power, though
given him by the Law of his creation by <hi>God</hi> himſelf, but to uſe it
with modeſty and ſobriety, without the admiſſion of which
ſupplemental expoſition, theſe latter verſes for ought I know have no
coherence with the former. And thus I ſuppoſe we rightly take theſe words
as arguments of the womans ſubjection, nor deny we, but her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was
an argument why ſhe ſhould be covered But others who eagerly contend for a
Forreign and unuſual Interpretation of the word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that they may expedite their
buſineſs, paſs by or rather reject this argument from the reaſon of the
womans ſubjection, which is the moſt rational and certain, and frame
another of their own, as we ſay per ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>by a leap,</hi> or at
leaſt admit it. <hi>The man is not of the woman, but the woman of the
man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore ought the woman to wear a hood</hi> or
<hi>covering on her head,</hi> and therefore
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

frequent with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> who have no ſuch abundance of words, for
one and the ſame root as to the letters, to have divers ſignifications,
according to the pricks, and according to the divers ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to have
divers yet proper <hi>derivatives,</hi> which I ſuppoſe are not
promiſcuouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated one to another; or perhaps the ſame root or
word written with the very ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be <hi>Hebrew, Syriack</hi> and
<hi>Arabick.</hi> And ſo if we may believe <hi>Schindler,</hi> this very word
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which ſignifies peplum <hi>a
veil,</hi> is <pb n="196" facs="tcp:97245:106"/> an <hi>Arabick word,</hi> and not an
<hi>Hebrew</hi> one, ſo that I cannot poſſibly think, that this notion
ever came into the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> thoughts, but that he rather indeavoured
to expreſs what he meant in the moſt vulgar ſpeech and common phraſe.
And truly this argument of theirs ſeems to me very prepoſterous, as if they
meant to tie two extreams together without a <hi>medium.</hi> For who with
reaſon can affirm, <hi>Becauſe a man is not of the woman, but the woman of
the man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore ought a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to wear a veil or a hood on
her head,</hi> by an argument fetcht from the moral Law of their creation?
truly I have often heard that the whole Law of <hi>God</hi> was to be known by
the diſcourſe of reaſon, and was called <hi>moral,</hi> except the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> which ſome will not have therefore counted <hi>moral,</hi>
becauſe it is not to be known by the diſcourſe of reaſon. But whoever
could from the dictate of reaſon know, that a woman becauſe ſhe was made
of man and for man, ought therefore to wear a veil or hood on her head
<hi>eſpecially</hi> in the Church? That ſhe is therefore inferiour to her
husband, and that therefore ſhe ought to be ſubject unto him, is not
abhorrent from the diſcourſe of reaſon, and becauſe ſhe is for that
cauſe ſubject to her husband, reaſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates ſhe ought to acknowledge
it, but by what means or ſign ſhe ſhould do it in the Church or
elſewhere, <hi>cuſtom</hi> ſeems only to <pb n="197" facs="tcp:97245:106"/> have
taught, eſpecially in Chriſtian Churches, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
intimates in this place. For we read not of any ſuch <hi>cuſtom</hi> in the
<hi>Old Teſtament. Rebecca</hi> truly might [which they inſtance for an
example] when ſhe came near to <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> c. 24. v. 65. <hi>take
a veil,</hi> and <hi>cover herſelf</hi> as well for <hi>modeſty</hi> as for
<hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</hi> But <hi>Judah</hi> thought <hi>Thamar</hi> to be an
<hi>Harlot,</hi> becauſe <hi>ſhe covered herſelf with a veil,</hi> Gen.
c. 38. v. 14.15. So that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the covering of a veil was no
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign of ſubjection. And therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſtill of the
ſame opinion, that it is rightly interpreted according to the order of the
arguments. <hi>Becauſe the woman is of the man, and the man not of the
woman,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For this cauſe ought a woman to acknowledge the power
in her head,</hi> that is, <hi>her husband,</hi> according to the legitimate
and known accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. That is, ought to be ſubject to her husband, and becauſe ſhe
is ſubject, ought in ſign of her ſubjection to be covered in the Church,
becauſe it was <hi>comely</hi> and according to the inſtitute of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
v. 13, 14. As for the following words,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I conceive they are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expounded, either <hi>by</hi> or <hi>becauſe of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> that is, by
or becauſe of the Law of their creation or the ordinance of <hi>God,</hi> who
in the firſt creation did create them in that order by the Miniſtery of
<hi>Angels,</hi> and at the ſame time by <pb n="198" facs="tcp:97245:107"/> the ſame
Miniſtery of <hi>Angels</hi> did impoſe this Law of ſubjection upon the
woman, of which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> maketh mention 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> c. 14. v.
34. where the woman is commanded to be under obedience,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

whereof you may ſee more at large in Note on <hi>Acts</hi> c. 7. v. 35. In
concluſion, this Interpretation doth flow ſo naturally from the words, and
hath ſo little need of any Forreign help for its explication, that I have a

it is impoſſible to renew again unto Repentance thoſe who have been once
inlightned, and have taſted the heavenly gift, and been partakers of the holy
Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to

doctrines <hi>of Repentance, of Faith in God, and of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> &amp;c.

conſiſted in perſeverance. For <hi>this he ſaith he urgeth to no other

<hi>God</hi> ſuffered ſtill to remain in his holy Temple, that they could
not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally without reluctance free themſelves from obſervance of them,

profeſſion,</hi> c. 4. v. 14. <hi>that they hold faſt the profeſſion

ſtrengthens with arguments from the excellency of the promiſe, and the
credit of the promiſer. Whatever he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth in this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of
the Law, of its <hi>types</hi> and <hi>ceremonies,</hi> of their invalidity and

whom (being a perſon of ſo eminent a name) I expected to be ſatisfied in
all my doubts; But when I had attentively read him over, I became more
incertain then before, or at leaſt not at all edified in my judgment: For he
confidently determines contrary to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion of the
<hi>Fathers,</hi> and of all later <hi>Interpreters,</hi> that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was <pb n="267" facs="tcp:97245:141"/> the very ſame
<hi>Melchizedec</hi> who met <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 14.
<hi>being cloathed in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhape, with a habit of a high Prieſt and
King.</hi> His opinion being fixt in this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Melchiſedeci
Sacerdotium à D. Paulo perpetuum atque infinitum conſtitui, <hi>That
the Prieſthood of Melchizedec was by</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Paul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to be
infinite and perpetual, becauſe its ſaid,</hi> v. 3. <hi>that he remains a

liveth.</hi> From whence he neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, Si Meſſiam atque
Melchiſedecum non eſſe unum eundemque ſed duos credimus, <hi>&amp;c. If
we believe that the Meſſias and Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec were not one and the ſame,
but two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, then muſt there be two Prieſts, whoſe function,
circumſcribed with no ſpace of years, indures for ever. Which certainly
none of the Ancient nor later Interpreters yet ever ſo much as dreamed of.
And if this be not the true and genuine meaning of the words of</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Paul, there's an end of interpreting the Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi>
Thus <hi>Cunaeus.</hi> But when this opinion hath been exploded from all

left, which doth reconcile theſe apparent difficulties in the Text fairly

<hi>Fourthly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> this interpretation avoids two
egregious contradictions, the one in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a mortal man ſhould live
for ever, the other in Faith, that there ſhould be two high Prieſts that
ſhould remain for ever. And now follows the other difficulty which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
from, v. 8. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Et hic quidem

tythes, but there he that receiveth them, lives for ever.</hi> From whence it
is concluded without contradiction, that <hi>Melchizedec</hi> is there ſaid
to live, becauſe he who receiveth tythes is ſaid to live, but no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in
the foregoing words is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived tythes but <hi>Melchizedec</hi>
who received them from <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therefore it muſt be
<hi>Melchizedec,</hi> of whom it <hi>is witneſſed that he liveth.</hi>
Whereto it is briefly anſwered, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the word [accipit,
<hi>receiveth</hi>] is not in the <hi>Greek</hi> Text. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that
the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth no where ſay that <hi>Melchizedec</hi> liveth.
What then? is the ſenſe deficient? by no means. It perfectly and formally
agrees with the whole order of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> diſcourſe both in
this Chapter, and the foregoing Chapter and the following, but eſpecially
with v. 23, 24, 25. of this inſtant Chapter, Where we have the ſelf ſame
ſenſe as to the matter, the words only varied.

follows, that it cannot in this place be underſtood that the

defend this expoſition, and that is, Non valeret hoc quidem in aliis, ſed
in Melchiſedeco quatenus <pb n="278" facs="tcp:97245:147"/> eſt imago Chriſti, valere
debet, <hi>This were not of validity in any elſe, but in Melchizedec it
muſt be ſo, becauſe he is the type of Chriſt,</hi> hath more
preſumption in it then reaſon or Authority; And certainly the
conceſſion of this interpretation as rational and lawful, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<hi>Cunaeus</hi> into that vain (in my judgment) opinion, that <hi>Jeſus</hi>
and <hi>Melchizedec</hi> were one and the ſame perſon, and that, as he
thought, out of a neceſſary conſequence, that there might not be ſaid
to be two <hi>high Prieſts,</hi> who would remain for ever. <hi>Fiftly,</hi>
becauſe this very Chapter doth ſo often teſtifie that the meaning of the
words is ſo, as you may ſee, v. 13. <hi>For he of whom theſe things are
ſpoken</hi> was evidently Jeſus, <hi>our Lord of the tribe of Juda,</hi> v.
14. But what are the things are ſpoken of him? to wit, that he is <hi>entred
into the inner vail,</hi> that <hi>he remains a Prieſt for ever,</hi> and
that <hi>of him it is witneſſed that he liveth,</hi> which is alſo
farther teſtified, v. 16. v. 23 24 25. and v. 28. So that it is more
manifeſt then the <hi>Noon</hi> day, that, <hi>[of whom it is witneſſed
that he liveth]</hi> cannot poſſibly be underſtood of any other then of
<hi>Jeſus. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> our interpretation ſo
perfectly accommodates the ſenſe, and reconciles all the difficulties which
riſe out of the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that I ſee no reaſon why it
ſhould not be accepted, eſpecially having nothing in it contrary to
<hi>Syntax,</hi> reaſon or <hi>Scripture,</hi> but <pb n="279" facs="tcp:97245:147"/>

which way you pleaſe, the ſenſe is ſtill the ſame. And that is this,
That the Sacrifice or Oblation which <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered on the Croſs
by the ſprinkling or effuſion of his bloud, did ſpeak better things to
the pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or atonement of the wrath of <hi>God,</hi> then did the

in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time <hi>Chriſt</hi> offered on the Croſs by the
effuſion of his bloud, and for this very thing, becauſe <hi>Abel</hi> the
firſt of all men living offered an offering to the <hi>Lord</hi> of the
firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of his flock, whereby he teſtified his Faith in
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to come and offer himſelf an oblation for the ſins of the

<hi>Abel</hi> and to his offering. For <hi>by Faith</hi> is <hi>Abel</hi>
ſaid to have <hi>offered unto God a better Sacrifice then Cain,</hi> c 11. v.
4. and for this Faiths ſake did he <hi>obtain a Teſtimony that he was
righteous.</hi> When therefore that Sacrifice of <hi>Abel</hi> was but a
<hi>type</hi> or ſhadow of that great ſprinkling of bloud which taketh away
the ſins of the world, it is no more to be compared with it which is the

beloved of God foreſeeing by a divine ſpirit that ſome extraordinary
Sacrifice pretious in the ſight of God would one day come to men, that
ſhould expiate the ſins of the whole world, did in the mean while
perform</hi> or <hi>act its ſigns and figures, as Prophets typically
expreſſing that which was to come,</hi> But to ſay that the bloud of
<hi>Chriſt ſpeaks better things then the bloud of Abel</hi> which cries to
heaven for vengeance, to ſpeak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, agrees not with the ſcope of
the place, it having been the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> great labour to demonſtrate
how invalid the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the old Law were to acquire eternal
life, and how much in that reſpect the covenant of the <hi>New
Teſtament</hi> was beyond that of the <hi>Old,</hi> as is evidently apparent
by the whole ſeries of his diſcourſe, c. 9, and 10. But to ſpeak the
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, with reverence to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is
contrary to the very rules of <hi>Logick.</hi>

better, is better then that which is good, therefore the types of thoſe
things which are in heaven are good, for if the types were evil, then would
thoſe things whereof they are a type be evil alſo.</hi> But to cry for
vengeance, and to cry for grace, are the whole heavens different and contrary
natures. Neither can the bloud of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſaid to be better then
the proper bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> which was not at all good, no not
<hi>typically</hi> to that intent and purpoſe to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> his
bloud was, to wit, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, and the expiation of the

the conſideration of the conſtruction of theſe words it ſeems to me

               </gap>, and that they
muſt be therefore ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thus, <hi>Or do you think the Scripture ſaith in
vain, That the ſpirit which dwelleth in us luſteth to envy? But it giveth a
greater grace, for that it ſaith,</hi> God <hi>reſiſteth the proud and
giveth grace to the humble.</hi> The ſenſe and coherence being thus, He
adviſeth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſtrife and envying, againſt wars and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which he tells them <hi>proceed from their luſts,</hi> for confirmation
whereof he produceth a Teſtimony of <hi>Scripture. Do you think the Scripture
ſaith in vain, the Spirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envy?</hi> as if
it had ſaid, theſe bitter envyings come from the luſts of the ſpirit
that is within us. Surely no. The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> ſaith it not in vain.
The ſpirit of man is carried on with paſſion unto envy, and from thence
it comes, becauſe he cannot enjoy what the luſt of his eye deſires, he
endeavours to ſatisfie his luſt by obtaining his deſires by force. But
the <hi>Scripture</hi> tendereth a more gracious <pb n="291" facs="tcp:97245:153"/>
comfort, when it ſaith that <hi>God reſiſteth the proud,</hi> and
<hi>giveth grace,</hi> that is, ſheweth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>to the humble.</hi>
Intimating thereby, that though we be naturally prone to ſtrife and envy, yet
if we humble our ſelves before <hi>God,</hi> to which he exhorts us in the
following words, he will ſhew favour to us. Where this <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is
in expreſs words, I cannot tell, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Writings of the
<hi>Prophets</hi> which are loſt. As elſewhere the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi>

them unknown and incredible, if not altogether imperceptible, [nay ſome of
the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.] It was the ſpeech of one
of their great <hi>Philoſophers, Seneca</hi> by name, Hora illa decretoria
non eſt animo ſuprema ſed corpori, The <hi>determinate hour,</hi> of
death, <hi>is not the laſt to the ſoul, but to the body.</hi> It was no
ſmall matter to reach the immortality of the Soul, the top of their
knowledge, but of the Reſurrection of the body <hi>Philoſophers</hi>
ſcarce ever dreamed of. <hi>Mornaeus</hi> tells us of <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſtres,</hi>
who is of ſome reported to have held this opinion, Quod animae immortales
ſunt, &amp; quod corporum Reſurrectio univerſalis futura, <hi>That Souls
are immortal, and that there ſhall be a univerſal Reſurrection of
bodies.</hi> But this, but, à pleriſque profertur, <hi>many ſay
ſo,</hi> but no certainty thereof. And <hi>Lactantius</hi> tells us of
<hi>Chryſippus</hi> who had an imperfect notion of it, the ſumm whereof was
this. That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death within ſome period of time,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

the ſame <hi>Numerical</hi> body, or whether by this ſame form he mean not
the Soul, as the reſt of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> did, or whether he
meant not rather the <hi>Pythagorean Metempſychoſis?</hi> But this I ſay 
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:97245:158"/> was a greater myſtery then that <hi>Allegorical</hi>
waſhing of the Soul by which its ſaid to be cleanſed by the bloud of
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> The notion of Reſurrection was far higher, the very life
and <hi>myſtery of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as <hi>Zonaras</hi> calls it.
It is indeed the ſtupendious myſtery of myſteries, wherein to believe
conſiſts the foundation of eternal happineſs. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> the

c. 1. v. 4. This I ſay again was a myſtery beyond all <hi>Philoſophical
Speculation,</hi> and therefore there was need of ſome ſignificant
<hi>type</hi> or figure, which might make ſo impenetrable a notion familiar
and perceptable to the ſenſe of man, to which purpoſe nothing ſeemed
more fit and eaſie in the wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> then the burying of our

for by Baptiſm we are buried together and as it were drowned with Chriſt

<hi>irrefragable</hi> doctrines, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm is
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and ſolely, the type of the death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> by Faith wherein we are aſſured of the humanity and Godhead
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the very foundation of our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
Faith. And <hi>Secondly, of the Reſurrection of all true Chriſtians,</hi>
who are Baptized in, and live according to that Faith, knowing that if they
ſhall riſe from the death of ſin to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, they ſhall
alſo after death with <hi>Chriſt</hi> ariſe to glory. I ſhall only add
the Judgment of an ingenuous and learned man, whoſe Teſtimony in this
matter is not to be ſuſpected or refuſed. His words are theſe, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
quamvis immerſionis Caeremonia &amp; olim fuit communior, <hi>&amp;c. Though
the Ceremony of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion was anciently more common, as appears by the
unanimous diſcourſe of the Fathers when <pb n="304" facs="tcp:97245:160"/> they ſpeak
of this matter, and doth more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſent the death, burial, and
Reſurrection of the Lord and us, which are myſtically done in Baptiſm.
The which ſignification of immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Fathers do often urge,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>From whence</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Thomas <hi>affirms that the Ceremony or rite
of dipping is the moſt commendable, Yet there have been many reaſons</hi>
for <hi>which ſometimes it was convenient to change this cuſtom of dipping
into ſome other kind of Ceremony near unto it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From hence
therefore the Ceremony of perfuſion</hi> or <hi>pouring on of water as middle
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſprinkling and dipping was much in uſe, which cuſtom</hi>
Bonaventure <hi>ſaith was in his time much obſerved in the French Churches
and ſome others, though he confeſs the Ceremony of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was the more
common, the more fit, and the more ſecure, as</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Thomas <hi>teacheth.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever where the cuſtom of perfuſion,</hi> or <hi>aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſprinkling of, or pouring on of the water is now in uſe, it ought not to be
altered by private Authority. Nay ſince now it is ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in
practiſe throughout the Church, it ought by no means to be call'd in
queſtion.</hi> Thus far <hi>Eſtius.</hi> In whoſe words we have a
manifeſt and ingenious conceſſion, that dipping was the Ancient Ceremony,
which conſtantly the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> taught, as more lively repreſenting
the Death, Burial, and Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and us, that the
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> held the ſame for the moſt ſecure and commendable
cuſtom, that <pb n="305" facs="tcp:97245:160"/> the cuſtom of <hi>perfuſion</hi>
crept in unawares into the <hi>Church,</hi> for what cauſes he mentions not.
But becauſe the cuſtom hath been long in uſe, he doth not think it fit it
ſhould be called into queſtion whether it be lawful or no. And to this
Judgment I willingly ſubſcribe, ſo as the Miniſters of
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> would teach the true and genuine reaſon of its
inſtitution, which by the change of the <hi>Ceremony</hi> is almoſt loſt,
ſo that they for the moſt part teach now a days that <hi>Allegorical</hi>
one of waſhing, occaſioned by the now conſtant cuſtom of
<hi>perfuſion,</hi> which I will not yet deny may be piouſly and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably taught ſometimes, for the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves did ſometimes do it. Though, with leave be
it ſpoken, I am ſtill of opinion, that it would be more for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
the <hi>Church,</hi> and for the peace and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Religion, if the old
cuſtom could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be reſtored, which ſurely it might ſafely
enough in reſpect of indangering the health of the Infants, if
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> were only to be adminiſtred at ſet times in the year, as
it was Antiently in the <hi>Church.</hi> Which cuſtom what ſhould hinder to
be revived I do not ſee, but the opinion of thoſe, who hold
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſo neceſſary to Salvation, as that without it there's
none to be hoped for, and yet in danger of death, there might be a liberty
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for it at other times. The caſe then being thus, I beſeech you
what ſo viſible affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <pb n="306" facs="tcp:97245:161"/> is there between burial
and waſhing, that <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm</hi> ſhould be thought to draw
its Original from the <hi>lotions</hi> or <hi>waſhings</hi> of the
<hi>Jews?</hi> If it were true that our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did ſignifie
waſhing or ablution, or were it true that the <hi>Jews</hi> did Anciently
admit into their Church either their Own or Proſelytes by colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
Baptiſm, which hath been ſo much urged by Learned men, they might be
proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, that the inſtitution of our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> was
fetch't from the <hi>Baptiſmes</hi> or <hi>waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> But when the contrary is made ſo evident concerning the
firſt, and there appears no certainty for the ſecond, I conceive there is
little reaſon to adhere to this new and uncertain doctrine which the
<hi>Fathers</hi> never heard or dreamed of. For that our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is
truly a <hi>type</hi> of burial, and Reſurrection, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and myſtical,
and not of waſhing, hath been already ſufficiently declared. And as for the
other argument, as it is far off from any cogency in it to force the
aſſent, ſo is it lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to very much queſtion, it having ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
help of the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, that I can ſcarce
find any footſteps of it in the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> They would derive
its Original from the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which ſignifies
<hi>dipping</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion,</hi> thereby notably ſhewing that they 
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97245:161"/> owe the notion of the word to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or
rather to the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For what affinity is there ſo near
between <hi>purgation,</hi> and <hi>immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cleanſing</hi> and
<hi>dipping?</hi> But the thing of it ſelf was ſo uncertain that the
<hi>Maſters</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did diſagree about it. For in the very Text
they urge which is cited out of the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud, Rabbi Eliezer</hi> doth
expreſly contradict <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> who was the firſt as far as I
can learn that ever did aſſert this kind of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> among the
<hi>Jews.</hi> For <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> who was at leaſt
<hi>coetaneous</hi> if not elder to <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> expreſly
ſaith, Proſelytum circumciſum &amp; non Baptizatum verum eſſe
Proſelytum, nam fic legimus de patribus, Abrahamo, Iſaaco, &amp; Jacobo,
qui circumciſi erant &amp; non Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zati, <hi>That a Proſelyte
circumciſed and not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized was a true Proſelyte, for ſo we read of our
Fathers Abraham, Iſaac, and Jacob, who were Circumciſed and not
Baptized.</hi> On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide <hi>Rabbi Joſhua</hi> affirms, Eum qui
Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizatus eſt &amp; non circumciſus eſſe Proſelytum, <hi>That he
was a Proſelyte who was Baptized and not circumciſed,</hi> But to which of
theſe ſhall I yield my belief? To <hi>Eliezer</hi> who affirms that which
the <hi>Scripture</hi> affirms, or to <hi>Joſhua</hi> who affirms that which
the <hi>Scripture</hi> no where mentions? Tis true the <hi>Maſters</hi>
ſtood all for <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> it was their intereſt ſo to do, it
was for the honour of their Religion, that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might be
ſaid to borrow their <pb n="308" facs="tcp:97245:162"/> 
               <hi>Ceremonies</hi> from them.
But when I ſee learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and judicious perſons in theſe times fetch the
foundations of truth from the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> and that to eſtabliſh a new
opinion, I cannot but wonder at it. Unde nobis miſſus eſt Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudus,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are the words of <hi>Buxtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius</hi> in his <hi>Synag.
Jud. From whence was the Talmud ſent us, that we ſhould give it ſo much
credit, as to believe that the Law of Moſes could or ought to be underſtood
by it?</hi> And if not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> much leſs the Law of the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> to which they were profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The
<hi>Talmud</hi> is called by the ſame <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> Errorum Labyrinthus,
&amp; fabularum Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum fundamentum, <hi>The Labyrinth of errours, and the
foundation of Jewiſh Fables,</hi> and it was firſt perfected and
acknowledged to be <hi>Authentick</hi> Five Hundred years after
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> and out of it <hi>Maimonides</hi> and all the reſt did
ſuck their learning. Surely therefore there's little reaſon to acquieſce
in its Authority, or Teſtimony. But what was the matter that this old
<hi>Rabbin</hi> ſhould ſo conſtantly deny that which was like to advance
the honour of his Religion, but that his conſcience was throughly convinc'd
of his aſſertion? I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the ingenuity of the man who
maintained the light of this truth ſo firmly againſt and amidſt ſo many
Impoſtours of his Nation, who perhaps thought it a Glorious Triumph to

ſo that it is an argument to me next to demonſtration, that two perſons
of ſuch eminency, both <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>coeval,</hi> the one ſhould
expreſly deny, the other in all his Hiſtory make no mention of this
<hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides if <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in the ſenſe of our
days had been in uſe among the <hi>Jews</hi> in former times, wherefore did
the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſay to <hi>John the Baptiſt, Joh.</hi> c. 1. v.
25. <hi>Why then Baptizeſt thou, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, nor
that Prophet?</hi> Do they not plainly intimate thereby, that there was no
uſe nor practiſe of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> before, and that it was a received
