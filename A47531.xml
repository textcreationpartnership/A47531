            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to faith. I believe the immortality of the Soul, I believe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurrection
of the body, and its reunition with the Soul, and life everla≈øting, I am no
friend to Purgatory, nor to any prayer, ≈øupplication or application to any
<hi>Saint,</hi> ≈øave only to our ≈øole <hi>Mediator Je≈øus Chri≈øt,</hi>
who for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular end a≈øcended into <hi>the holy of holies,</hi> that

that the Souls of the Godly do immediately after their ≈øeparation from their

properly called <pb n="94" facs="tcp:97245:55"/> heaven. One of who≈øe great Arguments is

then were received into heaven, which before the A≈øcen≈øion of
<hi>Chri≈øt</hi> were not a≈øcended. In an≈øwer whereunto, I do truly

But to meet the argument, I be≈øeech you, where were the Souls of the

For where ever they were, rea≈øon per≈øwades it, and Scripture doth not deny
it, in the ≈øame place was the Soul of <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and where was the
Soul of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> there was al≈øo the Soul of the <hi>Thief,</hi> They
were not yet A≈øcended, Neither ≈øurely were they in a place of torment, for
I cannot think it could be any comfort to the Thief, as I ≈øuppo≈øe, it was
intended, if <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øhould have told him that he ≈øhould be that
day with him in a place of torment, it mu≈øt therefore be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
concluded, that they were in ≈øome third place of re≈øt. In which place if we
affirm <pb n="96" facs="tcp:97245:56"/> that the Souls of all the Godly departed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
till the la≈øt day, what danger is there, what incommodity? If we believe, I
≈øay, and believe no more, that there remains to all a Re≈øurrection in the
la≈øt day, both <hi>Fathers</hi> and us, in which day we with them ≈øhall be
mo≈øt perfectly con≈øummate, and that in the mean while all <hi>the Souls of
the Godly are in the hands of God,</hi>

this que≈øtion requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a longer and larger di≈øqui≈øition, then to be

<hi>Gen.</hi> c. 12. v. 4. That <hi>Abraham</hi> went out of <hi>Charran</hi>
in the 75 year of his age, and c. 11. v. 26. that he was born in the 70 year of
<hi>Terah</hi> his age, and v. 32. that <hi>Terah</hi> was 205 years old when
he died. For from hence it follows that <hi>Terah</hi> overlived the departure
of <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Charran</hi> 60 years. Therefore to untie this

o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinions exploded, will have <hi>Abraham</hi> to be born in the 130 year
of <hi>Terahs</hi> age, and not in the 70, as others of Ancient times have
thought, for if to 130 years you add 75 which was the age of <hi>Abraham</hi>
when he went out of <hi>Charran,</hi> you fall ju≈øt into the true year of the
death of <hi>Terah.</hi> And to make this opinion good, they ≈øay, it is not

was born in that year, but that <hi>Terah lived</hi> 70 <hi>years and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat

≈øhe is the daughter of my Father, but not the daughter of my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
will not confidently conclude that <hi>Sarah</hi> was the Si≈øter of
<hi>Abraham</hi> and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Terah,</hi> but not by one and the
≈øame wife? e≈øpecially ≈øuch a Solemn a≈ø≈øeveration being added, as if

This Tran≈ølation makes this place ≈øubject to many mi≈øtakes and
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties out of which we are not yet fairly delivered. For fir≈øt it
implies by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the conjunction <hi>copulative,</hi> that
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> as well as the <hi>Fathers</hi> were carried over into
<hi>Sichem,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas <hi>Jacob</hi> was buried long before the

the Hittite,</hi> Gen. c. 50. v. 13. <pb n="120" facs="tcp:97245:68"/> Next it avoweth a
po≈øitive contradiction to the letter of the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> in
≈øaying that <hi>Abraham</hi> bought a burying place of the Sons of
<hi>Emmor</hi> the Father of <hi>Sichem,</hi> when as that which he bought was
of <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> the purcha≈øer of

his wife, where they buried I≈øaac and Rebecca his wife, and where he buried

both buried, (and their <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> al≈øo) its more
then probable, that all their <hi>Family</hi> was al≈øo bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
<hi>Jo≈øeph</hi> being only buried in <hi>Sichem</hi> (and probably his
<hi>Family,</hi>) according to the <hi>oath which he took of the Children of
I≈ørael,</hi> Gen. c. 50. v. 25. <hi>In a parcel of ground which Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob bought
of Emmor and gave his ≈øon Jo≈øeph for a portion above his Brethren,</hi> and

<hi>And the bodies of the≈øe,</hi> that is, of the brethren of <hi>Jo≈øeph,
were carried back by their Children and Grandchildren and buried in Hebron, But
Jo≈øephs bones were carried by the Hebrews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chanaan when they departed
out of Aegypt, as he had bound them by an oath,</hi> Gen c. 50. v. 25. Exod. c.
13. v. 19. According to which they were buried in <hi>Sichem, Jo≈ø.</hi> c.
24. v. 32. Neither was this at all abhorring from rea≈øon or duty, that they

<hi>Scaliger,</hi> is <hi>crux Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologorum.</hi> The truth is,
<hi>Interpreters</hi> al≈øo have not been a little vexed with it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom
there are not few, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this reading and interpretation, which our
<hi>Engli≈øh</hi> here have u≈øed. And this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plau≈øibly made good by
<hi>Beroaldus Chron. lib.</hi> 3. c. 4. by adding in his computation the years
of the Oppre≈ø≈øers to the number of tho≈øe of the Judges, which beginning
from the time that <hi>Cu≈øhanri≈øhathaim began to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs I≈ørael,</hi>
Judg. c. 3. v. 8. do make up the ju≈øt number of 450 years until

               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:97245:72"/> But be≈øides the ju≈øt exceptions
which may be taken to this account, as that the time of the <hi>Elders</hi> who
judged <hi>I≈ørael</hi> immediately after <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhua</hi> is not mentioned
nor comprized in it, who cannot be denied to have been <hi>Judges,</hi> though
how long, it is not evident in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Eu≈øebius</hi> ≈øaith,
<hi>Tradition gave them</hi> 18 <hi>years, Africanus</hi> allowed them 30, but
how long or ≈øhort ≈øo ever, it adds to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of 450 years, ≈øo that
the number can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ≈øo preci≈øe as he would have it: And be≈øides that
the 20 years of <hi>Samp≈øon,</hi> in which he Judged <hi>I≈ørael</hi> in the
days of the <hi>Phili≈øtins,</hi> into who≈øe hands <hi>God</hi> gave the
<hi>I≈øraelites</hi> the ≈øpace of 40 years, are to be deducted out of
tho≈øe days, which mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily make the account not to be ≈øo
exact. <hi>Beroaldus</hi> hath made him≈øelf an unan≈øwerable objection. And
that is this. Putting or ≈øuppo≈øing that the time from the coming out of
<hi>Aegypt</hi> to the building of the Temple may not be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtioned to be
other then 480 years, as it is punctually ≈øet down, 1 <hi>King.</hi> c. 6. v.
1. which account him≈øelf and <hi>Beza</hi> do both maintain is preci≈øely to
be ob≈øerved, if we allow 450 years to the Judges, adding 40 to
<hi>Mo≈øes</hi> in the wilderne≈øs, 18 to <hi>Jo≈øhua,</hi> (and none allow
him fewer) 40 to <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> 30 to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and
4 to <hi>Solomon</hi> before the beginning of the building of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> the whole will be (not reckoning the <hi>Elders</hi>) 582
years, <pb n="130" facs="tcp:97245:73"/> ≈øo as ob≈øerving his own rule, it is
impo≈ø≈øible that 450 years can be allowed to the times of the
<hi>Judges.</hi> Tis true he tells you, <hi>That it is to be noted for the
better under≈øtanding of the Apo≈øtle, That ≈øome years are repeated twice,
as the years of the I≈øraelites oppre≈ø≈øion are ≈øaid to be comprehended
in and referred to that ≈øumm of years, in which its ≈øaid there was peace,
and that the land had re≈øt from war. Whereof the Apo≈øtle being not at all
≈øolicitous, did nominate that ≈øumm, which all the ≈øeveral ≈øumms</hi>
[of Judges and Oppre≈ø≈øors] <hi>made up together.</hi> But that the
<hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> had the≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderations, the times of the
<hi>Elders</hi> and the 20 years of <hi>Samp≈øon</hi> making al≈øo the
account ≈øo imperfect and uncertain, or that he had none at all, is not
probable. Neither is it credible, that again≈øt the light of his own and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon knowledge he would have mentioned a ≈øumm of years which was not
reconcileable with the letter of holy <hi>Scripture.</hi> For that had been an
egregious ≈øcandal to the <hi>Jews.</hi> who were neither ignorant, nor
inob≈øervant of the computation of the Times. This read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and interpretation
therefore being ≈øubject to ≈øo ju≈øt exceptions, I ≈øuppo≈øe we may

17. that is to the time when <hi>the God of the children of I≈ørael cho≈øe
their Fathers,</hi> ≈øo as the words ought to be pointed, and rendred
otherwi≈øe then commonly they are in mo≈øt Tran≈ølations, in

≈øen≈øe read the <hi>Old Latin</hi> and the <hi>Aethiopick Interpreters.</hi>
Now this time wherein <hi>God</hi> may properly be ≈øaid to have cho≈øen
their Fathers, about 450 years before he gave them Judges, is by them computed
from the Birth of <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> in whom <hi>God</hi> may properly be ≈øaid
to have cho≈øen their Fathers. For <hi>God</hi> who had cho≈øen <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
out of all the people of the earth,</hi> out of the children of
<hi>Abraham</hi> at this time cho≈øe <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> in who≈øe Family the
Covenant was to re≈øt. And to make this computation evident; From the Birth of
<hi>I≈øaac</hi> they ≈øay, to the Birth of <hi>Jacob</hi> are 60 years, from
thence to their going into <hi>Aegypt</hi> 130, from thence to their coming out
210, from thence to their entrance into the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> 40, and
from thence to the divi≈øion of the Land, the time wherein it had re≈øt,
about which time its probable they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ≈øettle their Government by
<hi>Judges,</hi> 7 <pb n="132" facs="tcp:97245:74"/> years, which altogether make up 447.
And if it ≈øhould be reckoned from the year before when <hi>God</hi>
e≈øtabli≈øhed his Covenant between him≈øelf and <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>I≈øaac,</hi> even before he was born, <hi>and all his ≈øeed after
him,</hi> Gen. c. 17. v. 19. at which time <hi>God</hi> may be ≈øaid as
properly to have cho≈øen their Fathers if not more, then it will be 448 years,
which comes one year nearer to our number of 450. But <hi>our Learned and
Judicious <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øher</hi> makes it from the Birth of <hi>I≈øaac</hi> to the
divi≈øion of the Land (which he ≈øaith was <hi>about</hi> 450 <hi>years after
the election of the Fathers</hi>) 452 <hi>years.</hi> And others almo≈øt if

&amp;c. <hi>But to him that is of power to e≈øtabli≈øh you accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my
Go≈øpel,</hi> &amp;c. Why this <hi>Doxology</hi> is annexed now a days to the
end of this Chapter, I cannot but wonder at, when tis confe≈øt almo≈øt by
all, that the≈øe ver≈øes, to wit, the 25, 26, 27, are found in all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
copies, as they do al≈øo remain in the <hi>Greek Fathers,</hi> written in the
end of the 14 chapter, after tho≈øe words, <hi>What≈øoever is not of Faith,
is ≈øin,</hi> except the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> tran≈øcript, which (perhaps out
of abundant caution) reads it in both places. As far as I can conjecture of
this matter, it ≈øeems to me to be thus. There was a common opinion which
po≈ø≈øibly from <hi>Hieroms</hi> words upon this place was derived to
po≈øterity, that <hi>Marcion</hi> the <hi>Haeretique</hi> did ra≈øe or cut
out all the 15 <pb n="171" facs="tcp:97245:93"/> and 16 Chapters becau≈øe they thwarted
his opinion, and that he might the better cover his fraud, placed this
<hi>Doxology</hi> at the end of c. 14. becau≈øe he would have had the
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øtle to end there. But I do very much doubt that this was ever done by
him, though I will not que≈øtion but he endeavoured to ra≈øe out all the
re≈øt. I rather believe that the <hi>Orthodox Chri≈øtians</hi> of tho≈øe
times and their followers, induced with this opinion out of their zeal to meet
with <hi>Marcion,</hi> did purpo≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remove this <hi>Doxology</hi> from the
end of c. 14. where it was not fixed by the fraud of <hi>Marcion,</hi> but by
the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> him≈øelf, to the end of c. 16. that ≈øo they might
include all which <hi>Marcion</hi> would have ra≈øed out. I ≈øay they removed
it from its proper place for this cau≈øe, for I cannot conjecture for what
other rea≈øon they ≈øhould do it. Was it becau≈øe <hi>Doxologies</hi> were
more commodious in the end of an Epi≈øtle? ≈øurely no. For <hi>Eph.</hi> c.
3. v. 20, 21. there is the ≈øame <hi>Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> in the middle, and
<hi>Gal.</hi> c. 1. v. 5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> c. 1. v. 17. there is the like in
the beginning, and ≈øo in divers other places ≈øcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering through
<hi>Pauls</hi> Epi≈øtles, but none in the end of any, where it was his
≈øolemn cu≈øtom to u≈øe another <hi>Epilogue,</hi> which was <hi>his ≈øigne
in every Epi≈øtle, So I write, The grace of our Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt be with
you all, Amen.</hi> Or was it becau≈øe this <hi>Doxology</hi> was more
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily <pb n="172" facs="tcp:97245:94"/> fit and proper for the end of the
Epi≈øtle? ≈øurely no. For it hath no cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at all with the precedent
matter, but it ≈øuits and agreeth mo≈øt exactly well with the end of c. 14.
where when the Apo≈øtle had through the whole chapter almo≈øt di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øed
of the danger of a doubting mind, mo≈øt fitly follows this <hi>Doxology,</hi>

The force of the argument from the words preceding is this, 
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97245:104"/> 
               <hi>For the man is not of the woman but the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of
the man, neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the
man.</hi> v. 8, 9. Ergo, <hi>Therefore ought the woman to acknowledge</hi> or
<hi>account the power to be in her</hi> husband, who is her <hi>head.</hi> You
have the ≈øame argument, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> c. 2. v. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Let the
woman be in ≈øilence in all ≈øubjection, for I ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not a woman to
teach, nor to u≈øurp Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the man, but to be in ≈øilence.</hi> And
why ≈øo? <hi>For Adam was fir≈øt made, then Eve.</hi> So as for this very
cau≈øe ≈øhe ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the power in her husband, to whom ≈øhe
ought to be in ≈øubjection, and over whom ≈øhe ought not to u≈øurp
Authority. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arguments are both the ≈øame, why ≈øhould we
que≈øtion, but the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> intends the ≈øame direct ≈øen≈øe in
the one place, as in the other, when con≈øtruction and the u≈øe of words do
bear it? Why ≈øhould we fly to violent notions and remedies when there is no
need? The force of the other argument from the words that follow, v. 11, 12. is
this, becau≈øe they are a qualification or mitigation of the rigour of the
injunction, lea≈øt it might be taken by the husband in too ≈øtrict and
≈øevere a ≈øen≈øe. As if he ≈øhould ≈øay, Although a woman ought to
acknowledge the power in her husband by the Law of their creation which was
delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Angels, <hi>Gen.</hi> c. 3. v. 16. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈øs,
neither is the man without the woman, <pb n="194" facs="tcp:97245:105"/> nor the woman
without the man by the Lord, for as the woman is of the man, even ≈øo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo
is the man by the woman, but all things are of God.</hi> From whence is
nece≈ø≈øarily inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that ≈øuch is the mutual bond of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between
the man and the woman, that becau≈øe one cannot be without the other, and
becau≈øe whatever they be, they are all of <hi>God,</hi> the man ought not to
indulge, challenge or a≈ø≈øume by any means too much to his own power, though
given him by the Law of his creation by <hi>God</hi> him≈øelf, but to u≈øe it
with mode≈øty and ≈øobriety, without the admi≈ø≈øion of which
≈øupplemental expo≈øition, the≈øe latter ver≈øes for ought I know have no
coherence with the former. And thus I ≈øuppo≈øe we rightly take the≈øe words
as arguments of the womans ≈øubjection, nor deny we, but her ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was
an argument why ≈øhe ≈øhould be covered But others who eagerly contend for a

truly I have often heard that the whole Law of <hi>God</hi> was to be known by
the di≈øcour≈øe of rea≈øon, and was called <hi>moral,</hi> except the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> which ≈øome will not have therefore counted <hi>moral,</hi>
becau≈øe it is not to be known by the di≈øcour≈øe of rea≈øon. But whoever
could from the dictate of rea≈øon know, that a woman becau≈øe ≈øhe was made
of man and for man, ought therefore to wear a veil or hood on her head
<hi>e≈øpecially</hi> in the Church? That ≈øhe is therefore inferiour to her
husband, and that therefore ≈øhe ought to be ≈øubject unto him, is not
abhorrent from the di≈øcour≈øe of rea≈øon, and becau≈øe ≈øhe is for that
cau≈øe ≈øubject to her husband, rea≈øon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates ≈øhe ought to acknowledge
it, but by what means or ≈øign ≈øhe ≈øhould do it in the Church or
el≈øewhere, <hi>cu≈øtom</hi> ≈øeems only to <pb n="197" facs="tcp:97245:106"/> have
taught, e≈øpecially in Chri≈øtian Churches, as the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi>
intimates in this place. For we read not of any ≈øuch <hi>cu≈øtom</hi> in the

c. 38. v. 14.15. So that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the covering of a veil was no

becau≈øe this very Chapter doth ≈øo often te≈øtifie that the meaning of the

≈øpoken</hi> was evidently Je≈øus, <hi>our Lord of the tribe of Juda,</hi> v.
14. But what are the things are ≈øpoken of him? to wit, that he is <hi>entred

that <hi>of him it is witne≈ø≈øed that he liveth,</hi> which is al≈øo
farther te≈øtified, v. 16. v. 23 24 25. and v. 28. So that it is more

who are Baptized in, and live according to that Faith, knowing that if they
≈øhall ri≈øe from the death of ≈øin to new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of life, they ≈øhall
al≈øo after death with <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ari≈øe to glory. I ≈øhall only add
the Judgment of an ingenuous and learned man, who≈øe Te≈øtimony in this
matter is not to be ≈øu≈øpected or refu≈øed. His words are the≈øe, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro
quamvis immer≈øionis Caeremonia &amp; olim fuit communior, <hi>&amp;c. Though
the Ceremony of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer≈øion was anciently more common, as appears by the
unanimous di≈øcour≈øe of the Fathers when <pb n="304" facs="tcp:97245:160"/> they ≈øpeak
of this matter, and doth more live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repre≈øent the death, burial, and
Re≈øurrection of the Lord and us, which are my≈øtically done in Bapti≈øm.
The which ≈øignification of immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion the Fathers do often urge,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>From whence</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Thomas <hi>affirms that the Ceremony or rite
of dipping is the mo≈øt commendable, Yet there have been many rea≈øons</hi>
for <hi>which ≈øometimes it was convenient to change this cu≈øtom of dipping
into ≈øome other kind of Ceremony near unto it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>From hence
therefore the Ceremony of perfu≈øion</hi> or <hi>pouring on of water as middle
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ≈øprinkling and dipping was much in u≈øe, which cu≈øtom</hi>
Bonaventure <hi>≈øaith was in his time much ob≈øerved in the French Churches
and ≈øome others, though he confe≈øs the Ceremony of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping was the more
common, the more fit, and the more ≈øecure, as</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Thomas <hi>teacheth.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever where the cu≈øtom of perfu≈øion,</hi> or <hi>a≈øper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion,
≈øprinkling of, or pouring on of the water is now in u≈øe, it ought not to be
altered by private Authority. Nay ≈øince now it is ≈øo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in
practi≈øe throughout the Church, it ought by no means to be call'd in
que≈øtion.</hi> Thus far <hi>E≈øtius.</hi> In who≈øe words we have a
manife≈øt and ingenious conce≈ø≈øion, that dipping was the Ancient Ceremony,
which con≈øtantly the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> taught, as more lively repre≈øenting
the Death, Burial, and Re≈øurrection of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and us, that the
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> held the ≈øame for the mo≈øt ≈øecure and commendable
cu≈øtom, that <pb n="305" facs="tcp:97245:160"/> the cu≈øtom of <hi>perfu≈øion</hi>
crept in unawares into the <hi>Church,</hi> for what cau≈øes he mentions not.
But becau≈øe the cu≈øtom hath been long in u≈øe, he doth not think it fit it
≈øhould be called into que≈øtion whether it be lawful or no. And to this
Judgment I willingly ≈øub≈øcribe, ≈øo as the Mini≈øters of
<hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> would teach the true and genuine rea≈øon of its
in≈øtitution, which by the change of the <hi>Ceremony</hi> is almo≈øt lo≈øt,
≈øo that they for the mo≈øt part teach now a days that <hi>Allegorical</hi>
one of wa≈øhing, occa≈øioned by the now con≈øtant cu≈øtom of
<hi>perfu≈øion,</hi> which I will not yet deny may be piou≈øly and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably taught ≈øometimes, for the <hi>Fathers</hi> and the
<hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> them≈øelves did ≈øometimes do it. Though, with leave be
it ≈øpoken, I am ≈øtill of opinion, that it would be more for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
the <hi>Church,</hi> and for the peace and ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Religion, if the old
cu≈øtom could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be re≈øtored, which ≈øurely it might ≈øafely
enough in re≈øpect of indangering the health of the Infants, if
<hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> were only to be admini≈øtred at ≈øet times in the year, as
it was Antiently in the <hi>Church.</hi> Which cu≈øtom what ≈øhould hinder to
be revived I do not ≈øee, but the opinion of tho≈øe, who hold
<hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary to Salvation, as that without it there's
none to be hoped for, and yet in danger of death, there might be a liberty
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for it at other times. The ca≈øe then being thus, I be≈øeech you
what ≈øo vi≈øible affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <pb n="306" facs="tcp:97245:161"/> is there between burial
and wa≈øhing, that <hi>Chri≈øtian Bapti≈øm</hi> ≈øhould be thought to draw
its Original from the <hi>lotions</hi> or <hi>wa≈øhings</hi> of the
<hi>Jews?</hi> If it were true that our <hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> did ≈øignifie
wa≈øhing or ablution, or were it true that the <hi>Jews</hi> did Anciently
admit into their Church either their Own or Pro≈øelytes by colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
Bapti≈øm, which hath been ≈øo much urged by Learned men, they might be
proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arguments, that the in≈øtitution of our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øm</hi> was
fetch't from the <hi>Bapti≈ømes</hi> or <hi>wa≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> But when the contrary is made ≈øo evident concerning the
fir≈øt, and there appears no certainty for the ≈øecond, I conceive there is
little rea≈øon to adhere to this new and uncertain doctrine which the
<hi>Fathers</hi> never heard or dreamed of. For that our <hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> is
truly a <hi>type</hi> of burial, and Re≈øurrection, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral and my≈øtical,
and not of wa≈øhing, hath been already ≈øufficiently declared. And as for the
other argument, as it is far off from any cogency in it to force the
a≈ø≈øent, ≈øo is it lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to very much que≈øtion, it having ≈øo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
help of the Authority of <hi>Scripture</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, that I can ≈øcarce
find any foot≈øteps of it in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament.</hi> They would derive

But when I ≈øee learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and judicious per≈øons in the≈øe times fetch the

Jud. From whence was the Talmud ≈øent us, that we ≈øhould give it ≈øo much
credit, as to believe that the Law of Mo≈øes could or ought to be under≈øtood
by it?</hi> And if not the Law of <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> much le≈øs the Law of the
<hi>Go≈øpel</hi> to which they were profe≈ø≈øed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The
